# MemesCrawler

This app uses retrofit library to fetch JSON data from an API.

This app uses the API: https://github.com/D3vd/Meme_Api

API GET request: https://meme-api.herokuapp.com/gimme/100

We get the meme image URL from the JSON file and use the picasso library to display it in a ImageView.

All ImageViews are inside a CardView.

You can scroll through different memes. (RecyclerView was used for this)
